Guide to building and use BoWSLAM (for mosaicing, see mosaicing/README)

IMPORTANT NOTE: BoWSLAM is "experimental" and is under active development. It may or may not work with different versions of libraries to the ones listed, and the default configuration may or may not work well on your dataset. Try it with an "easy" dataset first (e.g. lots of features and no sharp corners).  

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: BoWSLAM is a single camera SLAM scheme, so does not make use of your robot's other sensors, like wheel encoders, or other assumptions about the robot's motion, e.g. that is is constrained to a plane. For small scale AR applications in static environments, with steady camera motion, you should probably use some bundle-adjustment based SLAM scheme, e.g. PTAM. 


Contents:
1) Required libraries
2) What to build
3) Configuration + running

Linux + gcc version 4.5 or later + Netbeans IDE 7.0.1 or later recommended!! Most of the libraries can be built and used in Windows, but I haven't tried porting everything.



1) Required libraries

All of my code requires the following 3 libraries (see http://www.hilandtom.com/tombotterill/code/index.php#install)

1) boost http://www.boost.org/ (version 1.42.0 or later) including compiled libraries. 

2) Eigen 3.0

3) opencv 2.2 (may work with 2.0 or 2.1; #define USE_OLD_OPENCV to use these)

4) BoWSLAM also requires 'board' library from libboard.sourceforge.net (for eps output)



These libraries must all be visible to gcc (automatic with OpenCV2.2, and the boost Ubuntu/Debian package).


2) What to build

a) Check out entire workspace: git clone https://github.com/kayak-tom/tom-cv

b) Compile using cmake. May require some minor fixes to work with your combination of libraries and compiler versions.

Install in Linux (use cmake)

cd to the tom-cv directory.

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make -j8

3) Configuration 

Edit a config file, e.g. workspace/BoWSLAM/config/params5-3-2.cfg
**You need to give a path to the folder where your images are found**


4) Camera calibration

Save a file called calib.txt *in the same folder as the source images*

Camera calibration file format: 3x3 calibration matrix, then number of radial distortion coefficients, then list of radial distortion coefficients. All seperated by whitespace. Example:
    739.0  0         403.31196
    0          735.0 257.79306
    0          0         1

    1
    -0.06887

At most 2 RD coefficients are supported: x *= 1 + K1 r^2 + K2 r^4
Note the difference in sign of K1, K2 from MATLAB camera calibration toolbox coefficients.

 
5) Running

cd workspace/BoWSLAM

Then start BoWSLAM with something like:
./Release/BoWSLAM ./config/params5-3-2.cfg
or
./Debug/BoWSLAM ./path/to/config/file.cfg

I've used workspace/BoWSLAM/config/params5-3-2.cfg for recent runs.


5) Tips

Use gcc 4.5 or later, or clang.

It helps if the first 10 or so frames are fairly easy (i.e. no rapid cornering, and not stationary), while the dictionary is initialised.

To get at position estimates use the TORO graph files (these are output at regular intervals). These list absolute positions and relative poses.
